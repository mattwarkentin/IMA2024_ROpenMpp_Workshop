# Matt Warkentin - Hands-on with R and OpenM++ for Microsimulation

- Presenting author: Matt Warkentin (University of Calgary, Canada)
- Authors: Matt Warkentin, Jean Yong, Michael Wolfson
- Topic: Microsimulation modeling platforms

OpenM++ is a powerful open-source platform for deploying microsimulation models at any scale. R is a powerful statistical language for data science, modelling, and data visualization. The harmony of R and OpenM++ provides a seamless interface to inspect, configure, and run microsimulation models and easily retrieve outputs/results for further processing, exploration, visualization, and reporting. In this workshop, we will teach you about the power of wrapping the OpenM++ API using the R language to provide a programmatic interface to microsimulation models with hands-on examples.

In this hands-on session we plan to cover:
-	A brief history and overview of OpenM++
-	How to use R to wrap the OpenM++ API
-	Some tricks-of-the-trade for using R to wrap APIs (e.g., R6 OOP, active bindings)
-	Introduction to the oncosimx R package
-	Hands-on examples for configuring and running large and small microsimulation ,odels using R/OpenM++
-	An introduction to the OncoSim suite of microsimulation models
-	Examples running large-scale population-based Canadian microsimulation disease models
-	Data exploration and visualization using R and the tidyverse
