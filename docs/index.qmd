# Brief history of OpenM++

Michael C. Wolfson, PhD

University of Ottawa

## What is OpenM++

> OpenM++ is an open-source platform to develop, use, and deploy micro-simulation or agent-based models. OpenM++ was designed to enable non-programmers to develop simple or complex models.

- Primarily written in C and C++

- Can install and run on Mac, Windows, and Linux

- _Heir apparent_ to __Modgen__
    + The OpenM++ language is based on the Modgen language developed at Statistics Canada. With minor modifications to model source code...

## Why supercede Modgen?

- Add some brief points here to provide context...

- [Introduction to Modgen](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/microsimulation/modgen/new/introduction/introduction)
    + For the interested reader...

## Why OpenM++: General features

- __Open source__: OpenM++ and all components are licensed under the very broad MIT license

- __Cross-platform__: Model development and use on Windows, Linux, or MacOS

- __Standards-based__: Uses industry standard formats and technologies

- __Zero-footprint__: File-based installation requires no elevation of privileges

::: footer
`r fa('link')` <https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html>
:::

## Why OpenM++: Model developer features

- __High-level language__: Model types, parameters, entities, events, tables, etc. are specified using a compact domain-specific language targeted to microsimulation

- __Scalable complexity__: From simple 'toy' models to highly complex models

- __Modularity__: New events and processes can be added to a model in a new module, often with little or no modification to existing modules.
continuous or discrete time, or a mixture

::: footer
`r fa('link')` <https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html>
:::

## Why OpenM++: Model developer features

- __Supports multiple versions__: Multiple OpenM++ versions can be installed and a single environment variable used to choose among them

- __Result compare__: Supports rapid comparison of all model outputs during incremental model development

::: footer
`r fa('link')` <https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html>
:::

## Why OpenM++: Computational features

- __Scalable computation__: Designed to scale linearly with population size or replicates when possible, N log N scaling for typical interacting populations

- __Grid-enabled, cloud-enabled__: Supports MPI for multi-processing to distribute execution of replicates to a small or large computational grid or to the cloud, with automatic result assembly

- __Multi-threaded__: Supports multi-threading for parallel execution of replicates on desktop or server

::: footer
`r fa('link')` <https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html>
:::

## Why OpenM++: Computational features

- __On-the-fly tabulation__: Tables are computed during the simulation, eliminating the need to output voluminous microdata for subsequent tabulation

- __Computationally efficient__: The model specification is transformed to C++ which is processed by an optimizing C++ compiler to produce a highly efficient executable program

::: footer
`r fa('link')` <https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html>
:::

## Why OpenM++: Usability features

- __Generated UI__: A model-specific UI is generated from the model specification

- __Browser-based UI__: The UI requires only a browser, and runs on almost any modern browser

- __Cloud-enabled__: Models can be deployed to a cloud and accessed remotely over the web, from a browser

- __Multilingual support__: For UI and for model, with real-time language switching

::: footer
`r fa('link')` <https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html>
:::

## Why OpenM++: Analyst features

- __Continuous time tabulation__: Powerful but easy to use language constructs to tabulate time-in-state, empirical hazards, transitions counts, state changes, etc.

- __Replicate support__: All tables can have underlying replicate simulations to assess the uncertainty of any cell of any output table. Statistical measures of uncertainty are computed for all cells of all tables

- __Automation__: Models can be controlled by scripts, _e.g._, Python or R

::: footer
`r fa('link')` <https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html>
:::

## Why OpenM++: Analyst features

- __Import/export__: Models and runs can be moved between databases, or to standard formats for upstream preparation of inputs or for downstream analysis of outputs

- __Dynamic run control__: A computational grid can process runs dynamically to enable whole-model estimation or calibration, with a controlling script reading run results and preparing new runs for execution

## OpenM++: Workshop focus

- This workshop will primarily focus on the "analysts" perspective for what the benefits are of using OpenM++

__OpenM++: Analyst features:__

> Automation: Models can be controlled by scripts, e.g., Python or R.

- How can we do this? 

- Why would we do this?

- What are the benefits?

## The setup

- You developed a microsimulation model in OpenM++. You can control the simulation using several (or many many) parameters and run the simulation to get output tables.
    + I come from the oncology world, so my models are cancer-focused, but yours might be finance, pensions, taxes, etc.

- You are like me, in that you __DO NOT__ like using graphical user interfaces (GUI) to configure and run models, because:
    + Lacks transparency
    + Lacks reproducibility
    + Does not scale well

## OpenM++ API

> The [OpenM++] model API provides programmatic access to scenario management, model inputs, model runs, and model outputs. It is implemented by the OpenM++ oms web service, which uses standard JSON to communicate with a controlling application.

`r fa('link')` [API Documentation](https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html#Oms-web-service-API)

- The OpenM++ API has over 100 endpoints for querying, setting, and deleting data

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(rvest)
read_html('https://openmpp.org/wiki/openmpp-wiki.html#Oms-web-service-API') |> 
  html_elements('h4') |> 
  map_chr(html_text) |> 
  enframe(NULL, 'endpoint') |> 
  filter(str_detect(endpoint, 'GET|PUT|POST|PATCH|DELETE')) |> 
  distinct(endpoint) |> 
  separate_wider_regex(endpoint, c('method' = '[[:upper:]]+', 'endpoint' = '.*')) |> 
  mutate(
    endpoint = str_remove(endpoint, '\\(.*\\)'),
    across(everything(), str_squish),
    endpoint = str_to_sentence(endpoint)
  ) |> 
  reactable::reactable(
    groupBy = 'method'
  )
```

## But, what is an API?

- Stands for _"Application Programming Interface"_
    + Is that helpful?
    
- In simple terms, it is a software for allowing two applications to _"communicate"_ with each other

- The communication occurs using a well-defined and structured language (_i.e._, send requests, receive responses)

- Most modern APIs conform to so-called "__REST__" standards (_i.e._, a RESTful API)

## API Schematic

![](assets/diagram-what-is-an-api-postman-illustration.svg)

::: footer
<https://www.postman.com/what-is-an-api/>
:::

## What is a RESTful API?

- A versatile interface for sending and retrieving data through HTTP requests in JSON or other formats (e.g., XML, CSV, plain-text)

- REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs represent an example of these interfaces since they use the principles underpinning the REST architectural design when communicating between clients and servers. 

- This design includes predefined sets of different operations parameters available via standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT or DELETE while allowing scalability.

## RESTful API request methods

- There are five popular kinds of API request methods: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

- __GET:__ retrieves information or data from a specified resource

- __POST:__ submits data to be processed to a specified resource

- __PUT:__ updates a specified resource with new data

- __DELETE:__ deletes a specified resource

- __PATCH:__ partially updates a specified resource

## Building an API request in R

We will utilize the `httr2` package...

```{r}
library(httr2)
```

```r
resp <- 
  request('url goes here...') |> 
  req_method('GET') |>
  req_perform()
```

```r
resp_status(resp)
resp_status_desc(resp)
resp_body_json(resp)
```

- Request methods are prefixed with `req_*`

- Response methods are prefixed with `resp_*`

::: footer
<https://httr2.r-lib.org>
:::

## Simple R API: Motivational Quotes

Let's do a simple example in R using the `{httr2}` package...

```{r}
library(httr2)

resp <- 
  request("https://zenquotes.io/api/quotes") |> 
  req_method('GET') |>
  req_perform() 

resp_status(resp)
resp_status_desc(resp)
```

## Simple R API: Motivational Quotes

```{r message=TRUE}
print(resp)
```

```{r}
quotes <- resp_body_json(resp)

quotes[[1]]$q
```

```{r}
quotes[[2]]$q
```

## Simple R API: Motivational Quotes

But even the previous example is a bit verbose for repeated use. Let's wrap this into a function.

```{r}
get_quote <- function() {
  resp <- 
    request("https://zenquotes.io/api/quotes") |> 
    req_method('GET') |>
    req_perform() |> 
    resp_body_json()
  resp[[1]]$q
}

get_quote()
```

# __Basic idea__: obfuscate the technical debt for making API requests in R into modular user-friendly functions {background-color='#ffa300'}

## A rich history of wrapping APIs...

![](assets/imports.png)

# Quick Recap

- We have briefly learned what APIs are and how we communicate with them

- We have learned how to wrap simple API requests into reusable R functions

- Next, we will step up in complexity to learn some more advanced techniques for wrapping APIs (e.g., OpenM++) that allow more sophisticated communications

# `r fa('r-project')` R Tricks-of-the-trade

## Object-oriented (OO) approach

- Traditionally, R uses the `S3` object-oriented system which is __functional__ by design
    
    + Objects have classes and functions act on classes
    
    + Generics and methods
    
- Other languages (_e.g._, Python) use an encapsulated OO approach

   + Objects ARE instances of a class definition and methods/attributes BELONG to classes

## When to use S3? Basically always...

> S3 is R’s first and simplest OO system. S3 is informal and ad hoc, but there is a certain elegance in its minimalism: you can’t take away any part of it and still have a useful OO system. __For these reasons, you should use it, unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise.__

- I think communicating with a stateful API connected to a database is a compelling reason

::: footer
<https://adv-r.hadley.nz/s3.html#introduction-12>
:::

## S3 OOS

- Generics are "general-purpose" functions that perform an action depending on what class of object it is presented with

- `print()`

- `summary()`

- There are many others

```{r echo=TRUE}
#| code-fold: true
print
```

## S3 OOS

```{r echo=TRUE}
print(mtcars)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
print(lm(mpg ~ hp, mtcars))
```

## R6 versus S3

From Advanced R (2e) by Hadley Wickham

- R6 is a profoundly different OO system from S3 and S4 because it is built on encapsulated objects, rather than generic functions. Additionally R6 objects have reference semantics, which means that they can be modified in place. These two big differences have a number of non-obvious consequences which we’ll explore here:

- A generic is a regular function so it lives in the global namespace. An R6 method belongs to an object so it lives in a local namespace. This influences how we think about naming.

::: footer
<https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo-tradeoffs.html#s3-r6>
:::

## R6 Encapsulated OOS

From Advanced R (2e) by Hadley Wickham

- R6’s reference semantics allow methods to simultaneously return a value and modify an object. This solves a painful problem called “threading state”.

- You invoke an R6 method using `$`, which is an infix operator. If you set up your methods correctly you can use chains of method calls as an alternative to the pipe.

::: footer
<https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo-tradeoffs.html#s3-r6>
:::

## R6 Encapsulated OOS

> R6 is an implemention of encapsulated object-oriented programming for R, and is a simpler, faster, lighter-weight alternative to R’s built-in reference classes. This style of programming is also sometimes referred to as classical object-oriented programming.

```r
## Standard use of S3 system
action(object)
```

Compared to...

```r
## Standard use of R6 system
object$action()
object$field
```

::: footer
<https://r6.r-lib.org/index.html>

## Dog example: S3 Approach

```{r}
bucky <- structure(
  list(
    name = 'bucky',
    noise = 'bark',
    species = 'dog'
  ),
  class = 'Dog'
)
```

```{r}
# New S3 method
print.Dog <- function(x) {
  cat(x$noise)
}
```

```{r}
print(bucky)
```

## Dog example: R6 approach

```{r}
library(R6)
```

```{r}
Dog <-
  R6Class(
    classname = 'Dog',
    public = list(
      name = NULL,
      species = 'dog',
      initialize = function(name) {
        self$name <- name
      },
      make_noise = function() cat('bark')
    )
  )
```

## Dog example: R6 approach

```{r}
bucky <- Dog$new('Bucky')
bucky
```

```{r}
bucky$species
```

```{r}
bucky$make_noise()
```

- With R6 OOS, attributes and methods BELONG to an object

## Active Bindings

> `makeActiveBinding()` installs `fun` in environment `env` so that getting the value of `sym` calls fun with no arguments, and assigning to `sym` calls `fun` with one argument, the value to be assigned. This allows the implementation of things like `C` variables linked to `R` variables and variables linked to databases

- Active bindings are a first-class feature in R6, so we typically don't use `makeActiveBinding` directly...

## Active Bindings

- That isn't a very clear definition, let me try...

- Active bindings __LOOK__ like standard R objects in your global/local environment, but:
    + When you __ACCESS__ the objects value it actually runs a function in the background
    + When you __ASSIGN__ to the object it runs a function with the assigned value as its only argument (_optionally_)

- __NOTE:__ Active bindings should be used sparingly, if at all. They are hard to reason about using standard R logic and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary

## Active Bindings

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  if (missing(x)) return(cat('This runs'))
  cat('Or this runs...')
}

makeActiveBinding('example_binding', f, .GlobalEnv)
```

```{r}
example_binding
```

```{r}
example_binding <- 100
```

## How does this help us?

- This feature is useful because our models/data live in a database and so it allows us to create bindings that always run functions in the background to communicate and stay _up-to-date_ with the server (i.e., OpenM++)

- Example: when a user tries to access an output table, a function is ran to retrieve the table in real-time to ensure it is accurate and up-to-date

```r
# Real-time communication with API behind-the-scenes
model_run$important_table
```

# Example: `oncosimx` R package

Programmatic interface to OpenM++ and OncoSimX

## Main Classes

- When using `oncosimx`, you will usually be interacting with one (or many) of three specific classes

- `OncoSimXModel`
    + Class def. for one of the OncoSimX models (e.g., All cancer, breast, cervical, colorectal, lung)

- `OncoSimXWorkset`
    + Class def. for a set of input parameters (i.e., scenario)

- `OncoSimXModelRun`
    + Class def. for a model run

## Additional Functions

- `get_models()`, `get_worksets()`, `get_model_runs()`

- `create_scenario()` / `create_workset()`

- `load_model()`, `load_workset()` / `load_scenario()`, `load_model_run()` / `load_run()`

- `delete_scenario()` / `delete_workset()`, `delete_run()`

Each of these functions is an API request to OpenM++ wrapped into a friendly helper function...

# {#schematic-id}

![](assets/illustrations/illustrations.001.jpeg){fig-align="center"}

## Design Considerations

- This is an _opinionated_ framework for programmatically interfacing with OpenM++ and the cloud-based interface to OncoSimX

- Design principle: abstract away the technical debt associated with calling APIs from R; from the users perspective, it should _look and feel_ like a normal R package

- Trying to achieve feature parity with the GUI

## First Hands-on Example: RiskPaths

> Being a model for the study of childlessness, the main event of RiskPaths is the first pregnancy (which is always assumed to lead to birth). Pregnancy can occur at any point in time after the 15th birthday, with risks changing by both age and union status. The underlying statistical models are piecewise constant hazard regressions. With respect to fertility this implies the assumption of a constant pregnancy risk for a given age group and union status.

- [RiskPaths: More Information](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/microsimulation/modgen/new/chap3/chap3-2#a1)

## First Hands-on Example: RiskPaths {.smaller}

- There are 7 configurable parameters (tables)

- Mortality
    + `CanDie`: Can a person die? (Yes or No)
    + `ProbMort`: Probability of death (by age)

- Fertility
    + `AgeBaselinePreg1`: Risk for first pregnancy (by age)
    + `UnionStatusPreg1`: Relative risk of union status on first pregnancy
    
- Unions
    + `AgeBaselineForm1`: Risk for first union formation (by age)
    + `UnionDurationBaseline`: Risk for union dissolution (by time)
    + `SeparationDurationBaseline`: Risk for 2nd union formation
  
- Women are assumed to stay single after the dissolution of a second union...

# `r fa('hands')` Hands-on Example {background-color='#ffe57b'}

__RiskPaths__: A model for the study of childlessness

## OncoSim and OncoSimX

> OncoSim is a free, web-based simulation tool that evaluates cancer control strategies. Combining data from the real world, expert opinion and the published literature, OncoSim projects health and economic outcomes, and attributes them to 19 risk factors, such as smoking and inadequate physical activity. It currently models four cancer sites (breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical) and related screening programs in detail, and provides high-level projections for 25 cancer sites

## Second Hands-on Example: OncoSim-AllCancers

> The OncoSim-All Cancers Model projects the incidence, deaths and healthcare costs of 25 cancers in Canada and attributes them to various risk factors.

## Closing remarks

- We learned (hopefully):
    + OpenM++ microsimulation platform
    + Brief introduction to APIs
    + Communication with APIs from R
    + Some advanced R techniques for real-time API connections

- The goal of this workshop was to be _illustrative_, not __prescriptive__. If you choose to use OpenM++ for your miscrosimulation needs, hopefully this workshop provided _food for thought_ about how best to interact with OpenM++ programmatically using R
